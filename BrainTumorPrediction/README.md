# Brain Tumor Prediction - Hack the Northeast 2021

### Solution Approach
Build and train a Convolutional Neural Network to detect if skin scans show signs of cancer.
* Once the program is run, the user can expect to see one of four messages: 
  1) The convolutional neural network predicts that this tumor is glioma tumor.
  2) The convolutional neural network predicts that this tumor is meningioma tumor.
  3) The convolutional neural network predicts that this tumor is pituitary tumor.
  4) The convolutional neural network predicts that this tumor is no tumor.


## Final Thoughts
* After training the model, our team was able to get it to classify images in the test set with **96.5% accuracy**. The model was trained using the Google Cloud Services

## Next Steps
* A next step that could be taken with this project is potentially pairing it with a mobile app so that photos can be taken by users and predictions can be made in real-time about the photos in question. The back end code is pretty much complete, so if the regression equation is exported and and paired with the front end code, a skin cancer detection app could be very possible.
