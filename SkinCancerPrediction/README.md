# Skin Cancer Prediction - Hack the Northeast 2021

### Solution Approach
Build and train a Convolutional Neural Network to detect if skin scans show signs of cancer.
* Once the program is run, the user can expect to see one of two messages: 
  1) The convolutional neural network predicts that this tumor is benign.
  2) The convolutional neural network predicts that this tumor is malignant

## Final Thoughts
* After training the model, our team was able to get it to classify images in the test set with **84.7% accuracy**. The model was trained using the Google Cloud Services

## Next Steps
* A next step that could be taken with this project is potentially pairing it with a mobile app so that photos can be taken by users and predictions can be made in real-time about the photos in question. The back end code is pretty much complete, so if the regression equation is exported and and paired with the front end code, a skin cancer detection app could be very possible.
